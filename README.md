# Goals of EDA

The goal of EDA is to allow data scientists to get deep insight into a data set and at the same time provide specific outcomes that a data scientist would want to extract from the data set. It includes:

1. List of outliers

2. Estimates for parameters

3. Uncertainties for those estimates

4. List of all important factors

5. Conclusions or assumptions as to whether certain individual factors are statistically essential

6. Optimal settings

7. A good predictive model
